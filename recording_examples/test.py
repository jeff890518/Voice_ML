higrid_example.py: Presents an example usage for HiGRID DOA estimation. Please see the comments in the code. 
NOTES:  1.  The code was tested on Mac OS 10.14.1 with Python 3.6. 
        2.  A known problem with other OSs (e.g. Ubuntu) mainly happens because of the differences in the directory 
            structure, which effectively results in problems with channel ordering.
        2.  HiGRID relies heavily on the healpy package which is only supported on Linux and Mac OS.
        3.  Please make sure that the individual microphone array channels are read in proper order.
